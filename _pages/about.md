Hello, I'm Inderjeet, an AI/ML Researcher at the Global Innovation Unit at NEC Corporation Japan. In my role, I focus on developing innovative techniques to create accurate, secure, private, and reliable computer vision-based systems. I've been fortunate to have filed 8 patents and published 7 research papers in international conferences and top-tier journals.

I'm passionate about bringing machine learning to a practical level to solve complex business problems, all while maintaining integrity, privacy, and reliability. I have a keen interest in computer vision, sensor fusion, federated learning, deep metric learning, and AI for healthcare.

Education

I hold a postgraduate degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, where I received the Institute Silver Medal. I'm also proud to have earned a University Gold Medal during my undergraduate studies, reflecting the highest grade in the university.

Sports

Beyond my professional and academic life, I'm a sports enthusiast.
