Hello and welcome! I'm **Inderjeet**, a Senior AI Researcher at **Fujitsu Research Europe**, where I'm driving the frontier of AI towards security, reliability, and practicality. My work is at the intersection of generative AI and trustworthy computing, with a particular focus on computer vision.

## Achievements 🏆

I take immense pride in my contributions to the scientific community, which include filing **8 patents** and publishing **7 papers** in esteemed international conferences and journals. My journey in AI is far from monolithic; I've explored multiple domains ranging from sensor fusion to federated learning, deep metric learning, and AI for healthcare. But what fuels my drive is not just theory; it's the transformation of theoretical frameworks into actionable, real-world solutions that elevate both business operations and societal well-being.

## Education 🎓

I hold a postgraduate degree in Operations Research from the **Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**, where I was honored with the **Institute Silver Medal**. During my undergraduate studies, I set the academic benchmark by earning a **University Gold Medal** for achieving the highest grade point average across the university.

## Sports & Beyond 🏸

Sports have been a cornerstone in my life, complementing my professional journey. I competed in badminton at the national level during my undergraduate studies in India, earning **silver medals twice**. I was also selected for national-level **Kho-Kho games**. My postgraduate life was no different, adding a **gold medal** in Kho-Kho during my tenure at IIT Bombay.
