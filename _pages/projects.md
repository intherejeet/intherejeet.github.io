### (1) Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning Techniques (Class-Imbalance Problem)

**Date**: May'18 to Apr'19  
**Type**: M.Tech Project  

Developed Meta Ensemble and capsule network models to enhance low and high-dimensional anomaly detection performance. This resulted in an accuracy of 0.9982% and f1-score of 0.97 on the credit card fraud data, and an accuracy of 99.98% and f1-score of 0.99 on the imbalanced MNIST data.

### (2) Modelling, Simulation and Resource Allocation for Epidemic Diseases

**Date**: Jan'18 to May'18  
**Type**: Course Project  

Developed a mathematical model, implementation in Python, and guidelines for simulating epidemic spread, considering birth-death and vaccination rates for various diseases (SI, SIS, and SIR model) and contact and recovery rates, and determining cost requirements for disease control in a given population fraction.

### (3) Bandits with Feedback Graphs

**Date**: Jan'19 to May'19  
**Type**: Course Project  

Evaluated five algorithms (Exp3.G, UCB-N, UCB-MaxN, Thompson-N, Thompson-MaxN) on a graph with probabilistic feedback and deduced that the Thompson-MaxN algorithm performs the best.

### (4) Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

**Date**: Jan'19 to May'19  
**Type**: Course Project  

Predicted bicycle demand using exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, achieving RMSLE score of 0.3418 with Gradient Boosted Regressor and comparing performance with multiple regression methods.

### (5) Home Credit Default Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

**Date**: Jan'19 to May'19  
**Type**: Course Project  

Developed DNNs, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM models while using PCA and SMOTE on the Home Credit Default Prediction Data.

### (6) Internet of Things (IoT) in Supply Chain Management

**Date**: Jan'18 to May'18  
**Type**: M.Tech Seminar  

Examined IoT, its background, different architectures and comparison to Industry 4.0, and evaluated a use-case of IoT application in drug supply chain information transfer.
